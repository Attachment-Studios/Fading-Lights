        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            Fading Lights is an Attachment Studios Original game made by Attachment Aditya. It's concept is tapping
            lights before it fades. Shader involvement is another speciality of the game, however if you one doesn't
            like it, it can easily be toggled. The background displays stars, again optional but makes scene iconic. It
            gives the feeling of fading stars in the space. Stars getting born and then dying. To make it like player it
            not destroying stuff, it can be assumed that player is taking stars and then keeping them safe.

        <h2>How To Play</h2>
        <p>
            To play when light pops up it needs to be interacted. That is we can also say to click or tap it
            according
            to the device. This shold increase score. Any misses and you lose and go back to menu.

    <div class="note" id="note">
        <h2>Note</h2>
        <p>
            Fading Lights is a mini game and that is why it was necessary to add save system to it for
            High-Scores and
            settings preferences. Hence game resets on restarting. Additionally due to shaders, the booting up
            of the
            game might be slow. Please be patient for that time. In case the game is very laggy and crashing,
            after
            starting immidiately stop all the shaders and stars. For even better, sometimes it may also be
            Audio, so
            that can also be toggled.
